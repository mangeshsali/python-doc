    <h3>What is Python?</h3>
    <span>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, 
        and released in 1991.</span>
        <p>It is used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>web development (server-side)</li>
            <li>software development,</li>
            <li>mathematics,</li>
            <li>system scripting.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Python?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
            <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
            <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.</li>
            <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.</li>
            <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>
        </ul>

<h4>Python Operators</h4>
<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

    In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
print(10 + 5)

    </code>
</B>    
<p>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>
<ul><li>Arithmetic operators</li>
<li>Assignment operators</li>
<li>Comparison operators</li>
<li>Logical operators</li>
<li>Identity operators</li>
<li>Membership operators</li>
<li>Bitwise operators</li>
</ul>
<h4>Python Arithmetic Operators</h4>
<p>Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:</p>

    <header>Python Data Types</header>
    <h3>Built-in Data Types</h3>
    <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.

        Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
        
        Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
    <p> Text Type:	str
        Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
        Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
        Mapping Type:	dict
        Set Types:	set, frozenset
        Boolean Type:	bool
        Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview</p>
    <B>
        <code>Example
        Print the data type of the variable x:<br>
        x = 5
        print(type(x))
    </code>
    </B>

<section class="main-section" id="Python_Lists">
    <header>Python Lists</header>
    <h3>List</h3>
    <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

        Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
        
        Lists are created using square brackets:</p>
        <B>
        <code>Example<br>
            Create a List:<br>
            
            thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
            print(thislist)<br></code>
            </B>
            <h4>List Items</h4>
            <p>List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

                List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Ordered</h4>
            <p>When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

                If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.</p>
            <span>
                Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.
            </span>
                <h4>List Length</h4>
            <p>To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:</p>
            <B>
            <code>Example
                Print the number of items in the list:<br>
                thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
                print(len(thislist)
            </code> 
            </B>
            <h4>List Items - Data Types</h4>
            <p>List items can be of any data type:</p>
            <B>
            <code>Example
                String, int and boolean data types:<br>
                list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]<br>
list3 = [True, False, False]<br>

    <h3>Tuple</h3>
    <p>Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

        Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
        
        A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
        
        Tuples are written with round brackets.</p>
        <B>
        <code>Example
            Create a Tuple:<br>
            
            thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")<br>
            print(thistuple)</code>
            </B>
            <h4>Tuple Items</h4>
            <p>Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

                Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
            <h4>Ordered</h4>
            <p>When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.</p>
            <h4>Unchangeable</h4>
            <p>Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.</p>
            <h4>Tuple Length</h4>
            <p>To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:</p>
            <B>
            <code>Example
                Print the number of items in the <br>
                
                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")<br>
                print(len(thistuple))</code>
                </B>
                <h4>Create Tuple With One Item</h4>
                <p>To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.</p>
                <B>
                    <code>Example
                    One item tuple, remember the comma:<br>
                    
                    thistuple = ("apple",)<br>
                    print(type(thistuple))<br>
                    
                    #NOT a tuple<br>
                    thistuple = ("apple")<br>
                    print(type(thistuple))</code>
                    </B>
                    <h4>Tuple Items - Data Types</h4>
                    <p>Tuple items can be of any data type:</p>
                    <B><code>Example
                        String, int and boolean data types:<br>
                        tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")<br>
                        tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)<br>
                        tuple3 = (True, False, False)<br>
                    </code>
                    </B>
                    <p>A tuple can contain different data types</p>
                    <B>
                    <code>Example
                        A tuple with strings, integers and boolean values:<br>
                        
                        tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")</code>

<h4>Set</h4>
<p>Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

    Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
    
    A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.</p>
<span>* Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.</span>
<p>Sets are written with curly brackets.</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Create a Set:

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
    </code>
</B><br><br>
<span>Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.</span>
<h4>Set Items</h4>
<p>Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.</p>
<h4>Unordered</h4>
<p>Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

    Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.</p>
<h4>Unchangeable</h4>
<p>Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.</p>
<span>Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.</span>
<h4>Duplicates Not Allowed</h4>
<p>Sets cannot have two items with the same value.Sets cannot have two items with the same value.</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Duplicate values will be ignored:<br><br>

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}<br><br>

print(thisset)

<section class="main-section" id="Python_If_Else">
    <header>Python If Else</header>
    <h3>Python Conditions and If statements</h3>
    <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Equals: a == b</li>
        <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
        <li>Less than: a </li>
        <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
        <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
        <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>
    <p>An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.</p>
    <B>
    <code>Example
        If statement:<br>
        
        a = 33<br>
        b = 200<br>
        if b > a:<br>
          print("b is greater than a")</code>
          </B>
          <p>In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".</p>
          <h4>Else</h4>
          <p>The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p> 
          <B>
          <code>Example<br>
              a = 200<br>
              b = 33<br>
              if b > a:<br>
                print("b is greater than a")<br>
              elif a == b:<br>
                print("a and b are equal")<br>
              else:<br>
                print("a is greater than b")</code>
                </B>
                <p>In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true, so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
  
                  You can also have an else without the elif:</p>
                  <B>
                      <code>Example
                      a = 200<br>
                      b = 33<br>
                      if b > a:
                        print("b is greater than a")<br>
                      else:<br>
                        print("b is not greater than a")</code>
                    </B>

        <hr>
<section class="main-section" id="Python_Elif">
    <header>Python Elif</header>
          <h4>Elif</h4> 
         <p>The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
         <B>
         <code>
            Example<br>
            a = 33<br>
            b = 33<br>
            if b > a:<br>
              print("b is greater than a")<br>
            elif a == b:<br>
              print("a and b are equal")<br>
         </code>
         </B>
         <p>In this example a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".</p>

        </code>
    </B>
<h4>Ordered or Unordered?</h4>
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
<p>When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

    Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.</p>
<h4>Changeable</h4>    
<p>Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created</p>
<h4>Duplicates Not Allowed</h4>
<p>Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:<br>

thisdict = {<br>
  "brand": "Ford",<br>
  "model": "Mustang",<br>
  "year": 1964,<br>
  "year": 2020<br>
}<br>
print(thisdict)
    </code>
</B>
<h4>Dictionary Length</h4>
<p>To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Print the number of items in the dictionary:

print(len(thisdict))
    </code>
</B>
<h4>type()</h4>
<p>From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict':</p>
<B>
    <code>
        < class 'dict'>
    </code>
</B>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
        Print the data type of a dictionary:<br>
        
        thisdict = {<br>
          "brand": "Ford",<br>
          "model": "Mustang",<br>
          "year": 1964<br>
        }<br>
        print(type(thisdict))<br>
          
    </code>

<section class="main-section" id="Python_For_Loops">
    <header>Python For Loops</header>
<p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

    This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
    
    With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Print each fruit in a fruit list:<br>

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
for x in fruits:<br>
  print(x)<br>
    </code>
</B>
<p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</p>
<h4>Looping Through a String</h4>
<p>Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":<br>

for x in "banana":<br>
  print(x)
    </code>
</B>
<h4>The break Statement</h4>
<p>With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
Exit the loop when x is "banana":<br>

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
for x in fruits:<br>
  print(x)<br>
  if x == "banana":<br>
    break<br>
    </code>
</B>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:
<br>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
for x in fruits:<br>
  if x == "banana":<br>
    break<br>
  print(x)
    </code>
</B>
<h4>The continue Statement</h4>
<p>With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
Do not print banana:<br>

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>
for x in fruits:<br>
  if x == "banana":<br>
    continue<br>
  print(x)<br>

    </code>
</B>
<h4>The range() Function</h4>
<p>To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
    The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.</p>
    <B>
        <code>
            Example
Using the range() function:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
        </code>
    </B><br><br>
    <span>Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.</span>
<p>The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Using the start parameter:<br>

for x in range(2, 6):<br>
  print(x)
    </code>
</B>
<p>The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):<br>

for x in range(2, 30, 3):<br>
  print(x)
    </code>
</B>
<h4>Else in For Loop</h4>
<p>The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:
<br>
for x in range(6):<br>
  print(x)<br>
else:<br>
  print("Finally finished!")
    </code>
</B><br><br>
<span>Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.</span>
<h4>Nested Loops</h4>
<p>A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

    The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
Print each adjective for every fruit:<br>

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]<br>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]<br>

for x in adj:<br>
  for y in fruits:<br>
    print(x, y)
    </code>
</B>

<section class="main-section" id="Python_Arrays">
    <header>Python Arrays</header>
<h4>Arrays</h4>
<span>Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.</span>
<p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
Create an array containing car names:
<br>
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

    </code>
</B>
<h4>What is an Array?</h4>
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

<h4>The Length of an Array</h4>
<p>Use the len() method to return the length of an array (the number of elements in an array).</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Return the number of elements in the cars array:<br>

x = len(cars)
    </code>
</B><br><br>
<span>Note: The length of an array is always one more than the highest array index.</span>
<h4>Removing Array Elements</h4>
<p>You can use the pop() method to remove an element from the array.</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Delete the second element of the cars array:

cars.pop(1)
    </code>
</B>
<p>You can also use the remove() method to remove an element from the array.</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example<br>
Delete the element that has the value "Volvo":<br>

cars.remove("Volvo")
    </code>
</B><br><br>
<span>Note: The list's remove() method only removes the first occurrence of the specified value.</span>
<h4>Array Methods</h4>
<p>Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays.</p>

        <th>Method</th>
        <th>Description</th>

<section class="main-section" id="Python_Classes_and_Objects">
    <header>Python Classes and Objects</header>
<p>Python is an object oriented programming language.

    Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
    
    A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p>
<h4>Create a Class</h4>
<p>To create a class, use the keyword class:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:<br>

class MyClass:<br>
  x = 5<br>
    </code>
</B>
<h4>Create Object</h4>
<p>Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:<br>

p1 = MyClass()<br>
print(p1.x)<br>
    </code>
</B>
<h4>The __init__() Function</h4>
<p>The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.

    To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
    
    All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
    
    Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:<br>

class Person:<br>
  def __init__(self, name, age):<br>
    self.name = name<br>
    self.age = age<br>

p1 = Person("John", 36)<br>

print(p1.name)<br>
print(p1.age)<br>
    </code>
</B><br><br>
<span>Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.</span>
<h4>Object Methods</h4>
<p>Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

    Let us create a method in the Person class:</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:<br>

class Person:<br>
  def __init__(self, name, age):<br>
    self.name = name<br>
    self.age = age<br>

  def myfunc(self):<br>
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)<br>

p1 = Person("John", 36)<br>
p1.myfunc()<br>
    </code>
</B><br><br>
<span>Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.</span>
<h4>The pass Statement</h4>
<p>class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.</p>
<B>
    <code>
        Example
class Person:
  pass
    </code>
